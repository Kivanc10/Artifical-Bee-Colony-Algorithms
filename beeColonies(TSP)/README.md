## what is the TSP
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), nodes
the cost (distance, time or
expense) to a minimum
to move the points only once
combinatorial optimization aimed at
Is the problem.
Vehicle with appropriate modeling of this problem
creation of routes, across the country
spread of higher education exams
control of consumables
delivery to retailers and unmanned
route planning of aircraft
ATMs, especially
checks, patrol services, service
route determination services
It may be provided.
In this context, a very wide application
fast and fast
analysis with high accuracy
is required. Node defined in the problem
for the solution due to the increasing number of
needed resource and to be spent
known to cause increased time

## what is the cost
<b>
 Cost is distances of arrive cities to other cities.And end of the algorithms you will have a lot of costs.Then you will determine the smallest cost inside of others .And you will develop and refactoring others to try to emulation accoridng to has best cost.

## To sum up purpose the algorithms for the TSP is that the find best path ,smallest cost and boundary for the traveling salesman decision problems.
