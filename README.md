# Bee Colony Algorithm

### Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the recently defined algorithms.It motivated by searching behavior of honey bees.

### ABC provides a population-based search procedure which individually called foods positions are modified by artificial bees with time.

### The bee's aim is discover places of food sources with high amount of nectar.Finally they detect one of the high nectar

### In ABC system, artificial bees fly around in a multidimensional search space and some (employed and onlooker bees) choose food sources depending on the experience of themselves and their nest mates, and adjust their positions.

### Some (scouts) fly and choose the food sources randomly without using experience. If the nectar amount of a new source is higher than that of the previous one in their memory, they memorize the new position and forget the previous one

### Thus, ABC system combines local search methods, carried out by employed and onlooker bees, with global search methods, managed by onlookers and scouts, attempting to balance exploration and exploitation process.

#### As summary ABC algorithms carry out some process it's inside , in addition to it aim that find high nectar with easy way
