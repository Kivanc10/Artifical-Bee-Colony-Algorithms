# Bee Colony Algorithm

### Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the most recently defined algorithms,motivated by the intelligent behavior of honey bees.
### ABC as an optimization tool, provides a population-based search procedure in which individuals called foods positions are modified by the artificial bees with time and the beeâ€™s aim is to discover the places of food sources with high nectar amount and finally the one with the highest nectar.
### In ABC system, artificial bees fly around in a multidimensional search space and some (employed and onlooker bees) choose food sources depending on the experience of themselves and their nest mates, and adjust their positions.

### Some (scouts) fly and choose the food sources randomly without using experience. If the nectar amount of a new source is higher than that of the previous one in their memory, they memorize the new position and forget the previous one

### Thus, ABC system combines local search methods, carried out by employed and onlooker bees, with global search methods, managed by onlookers and scouts, attempting to balance exploration and exploitation process.
